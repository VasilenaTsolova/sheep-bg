                    Sheep-farming after 1989

                    The first laws dedicated to land reform were two ordinances that appeared in
                    1989 authorizing a certain decentralization of agrarian production. They helped
                    the emergence of new agrarian structures, which were comparatively
                    independent from the state control. (Dobreva and Kozhuharova, 1994). During
                    the Transition, the most influential forces that shaped sheep breeding were
                    decentralization, privatization and the market forces. In order to avoid the
                    perpetuation of the existing “old type” organizations” in Bulgarian countryside, the
                    Law on Land contemplated the liquidation of collective farms and other similar
                    organizational structures. Then, according to a new law (The Law on
                    Cooperatives, adopted in 1999), cooperatives have to buy or lease land to
                    expand. In spite of having encountered many difficulties, the restitution process
                    was considered concluded at the end of year 2000 when 99% of the land subject
                    to restitution was delivered back to its owners. After the restitution process, half
                    of the total area of the country, i.e. 5,782,461 ha, was registered as “agricultural
                    land”. As a result, the restitution process caused three fundamental
                    transformations: privatization, duality and fragmentation. Almost all individual
                    farms are very small - of less than 1 ha, where the land is cultivated with the
                    objective of providing products for self-consumption and, if possible, some
                    additional income.

                    Sheep and Goats breeds in Bulgaria
                    After the Liberation of Bulgaria a new stage in the development of sheepbreeding started. Rams and ewes of European breeds, highly productive of milk and
                   wool, were imported. The work on sheep-breeding and breed improvement
                   advanced, new breeds of higher milk yield were created (K. Jelev et al., 2009). Since
                   the 80ies of the 19th c., Bulgarian state held a strict protectionist policy in the
                   development of that sector.
                   The agrarian reform after WW II abolished private farms and sheep-breeding
                   developed in the newly created collective and state farms (TKZS, DZS). The breed
                   trends also changed. Local breeds were crossed with rams of fine-fleece and semifine-fleece breeds. In that way four new fine-fleece breeds were created in the
                   lowland areas, two half fine-fleece breeds in the hilly areas and two tzigay breeds –
                   in the highland areas (K. Jelev et al., 2009).
                   In the early 90s of the 20th century Bulgaria had a unique gene pool – the
                   aboriginal breeds and their sub-breeds were more than fifteen. Some of them are
                   now believed irreversibly lost, but as a rule in the National gene bank sperm of highly
                   productive but endangered species is stored – the sperm can be used as a basis for
                   different genetic programs. The oldest “basic” breeds of sheep in Bulgaria are two –
                   tzakel whose distribution on the Bulgarian territory covers the western part of the
                   country and tzigay – the eastern. According to the academician Hlebarov (1940) “the
                   greater number of the sheep in Bulgaria and in the Balkans, however different their
                   morphological features may look, whatever local names they may have, are nothing
                   else than a form of the tzakel sheep breed”. The name “tzakel” comes from the
                   German word zig-zag, as the horns of the rams are shaped like stretched spirals
                   pointed forward. The local forms of sheep as Karakachan sheep, Replyan, Kula,
                   Panagyurishte, Shumen and Karnobat breeds are typical representatives of the
                   Bulgarian tzakel. The origin of the tzigay breed in Bulgaria comes from the Millet
                   fine-fleece sheep of the Greek colonists in the 7th century BC that settled on the
                   Black sea coast. From the tzigay sheep various types such as Copper-red Shumen
                   sheep, Blackhead Pleven sheep, White Dobrudzha sheep, Karnobat fine-fleece
                   sheep and others were bred (Hinkovski, Tz. et al., 1984). 
            </p>

                    Now more than thirty different breeds can be named. Over the years, to
                   the local breeds were added by breed crossings the Merinoland and Karakul
                   sheep, East-Friesian and Avassi sheep and recently Ile-de-France and Mouton
                   Sharole sheep. The Blackhead Pleven sheep and Stara Zagora sheep are
                   intermediate breeds, obtained by crossing of tzakel and tzigay types - they are
                   highly productive of milk, meat and wool. In 2003, the Association for Breeding
                   Indigenous Breeds in Bulgaria was established - the priority of their activity are
                   the Karakachan sheep (one of the oldest breeds in the Balkan Peninsula related
                   to nomadism), the Red-copper Shumen sheep, Duben and Replyan sheep,
                   whose stocks are expected to increase as a result of the funding under the
                   SAPARD program. Sheep of local breeds are now bred in many private farms. A
                   program is developed for storing genetic resources for sheep-breeding and for
                   preservation of 19 endangered local native populations (K. Jelev et al., 2009).
                   Meat and milk obtained from the old breeds of domestic animals are highly
                   valued for their high nutritional, taste and hygiene qualities. Their grazing areas
                   are the ecologically clean mountainous and hilly territories. Sheep milk is of high
                   fat contents and high-quality dairy products are prepared from it – curds, butter,
                   and cheese. The high-quality dried meat (pastarma) is produced from the meat
                   of the Panagyurishte sheep. Pigmented wool, much on demand in the textile
                   industry is obtained from the local sheep breeds as Copper-red Shumen,
                   Karnobat, Kotel, Pirdop, Panagyurishte and Karakachan (Hinkovski, Tz. et al.,
                   1984).

                    Bulgaria has patented nine sheep breeds – North-east Bulgarian finefleece, Danubian fine-fleece, Thracian fine-fleece, Karnobat fine-fleece, North
                   Bulgarian Corriedale, South-Bulgarian Corriedale, Stara Planina Tzigay,
                   Rhodopean Tzigay and Synthetic Population Bulgarian Milky, raised in the
                   respective regions of the country. In general, the largest concentration of sheep is
                   documented in the South Central, Northeast and Southeast regions of Bulgaria.
                    Research stations and institutes conduct work on selection of profitable
                   breeds estimated by milk yield and composition of milk indicators, fertility and
                   maturity of the new-born. Breed structure should certainly be considered not only
                   physiological, but also a historical category, because its formation, development
                   and adaptation is the result of the active human interference. The interest of 
                   private producers is targeted at raising sheep with increasing milk yield. As a
                   result, the fine-fleece and semi-fine-fleece sheep have decreased to fewer than
                   5% and the share of the dairy products has reached over 60% (K. Jelev et al.,
                   2009). Now in the country 37 sheep breeds are raised, 19 of them are
                   endangered native breeds.
                    The most common breeds are the Blackhead Pleven sheep and the
                   Synthetic Population Bulgarian Milky. There is a great interest of farmers to the
                   sheep bred for meat. In this aspect, industrial crossings with rams of Ile-deFrance and Mouton Sharole breeds have certain effect. According to Stankov, et
                   al. (2007), sheep bred for meat represent 10 – 15 % of the herds. Fine-fleece
                   sheep-breeding should not be excluded as a destination. The fine-fleece breeds
                   are combined into a single breed called Bulgarian merinos, 10 – 15 %; the Tzigay
                   sheep - into one breed Bulgarian Tzigay, 5 – 10%. The local (indigenous) breeds
                   – 19 in number, represent up to 5 – 10% and are our genetic resource.
                    Goat is one of the most unpretentions domestic animals. It is the most
                   economical milk domestic animal which finds food itself.
                    Suitable breeds of goats for plains and hilly areas in the country are
                   Bulgarian White Milky Breed, but in mountain areas – Togenburg goat. In the
                   plains for the production of different kinds of cheese is used Anglo-Nubian Goat
                   breed.
