                Brief Historical Background
                Geographical, geomorphological and climatic characteristics of Bulgaria
                proved particularly favourable to animal husbandry and especially – to pastoral
                economy and sheep farming.
                 Tending sheep has been one of the general occupations and trades
                of people since Prehistory. According to archaeological data and studies, since
                Prehistorical times (Neolithic – Bronze Age) many tribes on the Balkans and in
                Anatolia practiced particularly mobile pastoralism – due to its extensive nature.
                 In Antiquity Homer called Thrace “fat-soiled land” and “the Mother
                of sheep”. Proto-Bulgarians came in V – VI c. A.D. from the arid zones around
                the Caspian and the Black sea to settle on the Balkan Peninsula and brought
                their nomadic and semi-nomadic traditions. Slavic tribes from the Southern
                branch settled down on the Balkans in Byzantine provinces (V – VI c. A.D.), and
                brought quite different pastoral and agricultural traditions. All these economic
                and cultural traditions merged in the process of formation of the early medieval
                Bulgarian state.
                 In Medieval Bulgarian kingdom sheep-breeding and pastoral
                husbandry was widespread as an important branch of feudal economy. It was
                included in the system of feudal regulations and taxation. In Bulgaria and
                generally in the Balkans a special category of dependent pastoral population
                was registered – the so-called Vlachs (βλαχοι), whose trade and subsistence
                proves the continuity of mobile pastoral economy from Antiquity in Medieval ages. The
                denomination “Vlachs” appears for the first time in Byzantine sources not earlier
                than the XI century.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no clear information about sheep-breeding in Bulgaria in the
                course of Ottoman conquest. According to the testimony of the Ottoman analyst
                Mehmed Neshry, who described the prosperity of medieval Bulgaria just before it
                fell under Ottoman rule: “Sheep, butter and milk was flowing out from this land to
                the World.” This indirect evidence suggests the high level of development of
                animal husbandry and sheep-breeding in the XIV c. as one of the oldest
                economic traditions and trades of Bulgarians. 
                After the Liberation of Bulgaria (1878) the so-called Agrarian revolution started
                – a brief process of redistribution of land and changes in ownership but also in rapid
                increase of cultivated arable lands. It resulted in a complete change of the structure of
                modern Bulgarian economy and left no room for mobile pastoralism. Transhumance
                remained a type of extensive pastoral economy and proved incompatible with the 
                development of modern industrial society. After the decline of Transhumance in
                Bulgaria, in all the areas it was practiced, it was replaced by another type of mobile
                pastoral husbandry – the Mountain/Alpine husbandry. Among all the types and forms of
                traditional pre-industrial mobile pastoral economies, Alpine husbandry was distinguished
                by its higher potential for intensive development. 
                Sheep- farming (1944-1989)
            </p>
            <p>
                Sheep breeding used to be an extensive agricultural sub-sector of economy
                under centralized planning (1944–1989), after nationalization of the private agricultural
                land. In the period of socialism in Bulgaria cooperative labour farms were created
                (TKZS – in Bulgarian). The main target of agriculture was pooling and achieving of
                highest yields from plant-growing and stock-breeding. This forced the rapid
                mechanization of the agricultural sector (since the early 1970-s), large-scale
                installations for irrigation were built along all big rivers. At the same time the 1960–
                1980-ies of the last century was the period of rapid industrialization of the country’s
                economy. The intensive agriculture and the large-scale industrial developments caused
                environmental problems, the most serious being: pollution of soils due to extensive use
                of fertilizers and industrial production. The industrialization was followed by rapid
                urbanization which substituted pastures and agricultural land with housing estates and
                industrial zones.
                 The agricultural land belonged to the villages and was managed by
                the cooperatives (ТKZS and later on APK (Bulg.), i.e. Agro-Industrial Complex).
                The ownership structure of the land towards the end of 1980-s was characterized
                by state control of more than 80% of arable land and the domination of big
                collective farms, which occupied almost 60% of arable land (NSI). Meanwhile, the
                traditions for self-provision with agricultural production were kept and officially
                regulated: each household was allowed to use small plots (less than 0.1 ha) and
                breed some number of livestock (maximum number of sheep allowed was 5).
                During the centralized planning small personal plots occupied 13.1% of arable
                area, but only private rights of use were granted and no full ownership rights.
                Self-production was “the second occupation” of many Bulgarian, who could not 
                afford to substitute their occupation for the shepherd’s. That’s how the practice of
                neighborhood shepherding and milking was organized and sheltered in
                neighbourhood folders of 50–100 sheep.
