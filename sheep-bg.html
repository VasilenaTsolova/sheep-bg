            <h1> Important Zoonoses </h1>
            <h2>!!! Get educated !!!</h2>
            <h3>Diseases associated with direct contact</h3>
            <p>
                    <mark>Tuberculosis and brucellosis </mark> are potential zoonoses in sheep and goats but due to
                    a federally eradication program for Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella abortus and 
                    Brucella melitensis, these diseases are rare in the United States except in a 
                    few areas where it persists in a wildlife reservoir. Brucella ovis, the primary 
                    cause of brucellosis in sheep, does not cause disease in people.
                    <mark>Orf</mark> is a viral infection that causes red raised skin lesions around the face 
                    and mouth of lambs and the udder on ewes and does. Humans can be infected and 
                    develop similar pox-like lesions if they come into direct contact with an 
                    animal’s lesions. <mark>Dermatophytosis</mark> is a fungal skin infection commonly known 
                    as “ringworm” seen in both animals and people as scaly round areas of hair 
                    loss. Transmission of both ringworm and orf are by direct contact with an 
                    infected animal.
            </p>
            <h3>Diseases associated with contaminated material</h3>
            <p>
                    <mark>Q fever, Chlamydophila psittaci and Chlamydophila abortus</mark> 
                    are agents associated with abortion in pregnant sheep and goats but may 
                    be also carried by normal animals. There is an especially high concentration 
                    of these agents at the time that the animals give birth, so particular care 
                    needs to be used in handling new born animals, placental tissues and birth 
                    fluids. These agents can be acquired by exposure to placental membranes and 
                    fetuses from infected sheep or goats and by aerosol.<mark>Chlamydophila infections </mark>
                    in pregnant women are associated with infectious abortion or miscarriage.
                    Persons who are pregnant or with chronic disease conditions should consult 
                    their physician before working with pregnant or birthing sheep or goats.
                    <mark>Leptospirosis</mark> causes reproductive failure, liver and kidney disease in sheep 
                    and goats and is typically shed in the urine of infected animals. People acquire 
                    the infection by oral ingestion and contact with contaminated urine, placenta, 
                    and fetal tissues. The organism can infect through abraded skin.<mark>Salmonellosis, 
                    campylobacterosis, listeriosis, cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis</mark> are acquired 
                    by contact and oral ingestion of fecal material from infected animals. Animals 
                    infected with these diseases typically have diarrhea but some animals may show 
                    no symptoms of disease. Any animal with diarrhea should be suspect of having a 
                    zoonotic disease.
            </p>
            <h3>Transmission of zoonotic diseases</h3>
            <p>
                    Transmission of zoonotic diseases from animals is primarily by direct contact, 
                    contact with contaminated bedding or materials, oral ingestion or inhalation 
                    of aerosolized fluids. We can protect ourselves from most injuries and diseases 
                    by using the following procedures:
                    Handle animals safely to avoid injury.
                    Do not eat, drink, apply makeup or use tobacco products while handling animals or in animal housing areas.
                    Wear gloves when handling ill animals, animal tissues, body fluids and waste and wash hands after contact.
                    Wear dedicated protective clothing such as a lab coat or coveralls and shoe-covers or boots when handling animals. Launder the soiled clothing separate from your personal clothes and preferably at the animal facility.
                    Wear respiratory protection when appropriate.
                    Keep animal areas clean and disinfect equipment after using it on animals or in animal areas.
                    Most importantly, familiarize yourself about the animals that you will be working with and the 
                    potential zoonotic diseases associated with each species. If at any time, you suspect that you have
                    acquired a zoonotic disease, inform your supervisor and seek medical care.
